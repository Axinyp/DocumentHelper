## 1. NFC screen mirroring

NUF screen mirroring is supported only when all of the following three conditions are met:

1. The mobile phone must have NFC function
2. The NFC function of the mobile phone must be turned on
3. The mobile phone must have screen mirroring software

## 2. Instructions

1. After the mobile phone has turned on the NFC function (if the mobile phone has not used NFC, it needs to be turned on manually).
2. Use the back cover of the phone to stick to the NFC sticker.
3. The mobile phone will vibrate. If the mobile phone does not have screen mirroring software, the mobile phone will automatically jump to the download interface for downloading.
4. After downloading, touch an NFC sticker on the phone to start screen mirroring.

## 3. NFC writing

1. Click the setting button in the upper right corner of the screen mirroring software to enter the setting interface
