## 1.1 Quick meeting 

​         The quick meeting can be held at will, and a quick meeting can be initiated immediately by clicking on the quick meeting. After clicking to end the meeting, the meeting cannot be found in the meeting list on the home page, but the record can be queried in the background. In the event of an accident such as a sudden power failure, you can find unfinished meetings in the meeting list on the home page after turning on the phone, and click to continue or end the meeting. Some tools such as voting, scoring, sign-in, and quick file transfer can be used in the quick meeting.

## 1.2 Confidential meeting

​        Confidential meetings mean that the operation traces are kept confidential, and the materials generated during the meeting cannot be shared and saved. Screen capture and screen recording functions cannot be used in confidential meetings. Gadgets have confidentiality functions and cannot be shared, saved, scanned and taken away. Watermark effects are included throughout the meeting, and the camera is detachable to achieve the confidentiality of the picture and sound.

## 1.3 Schedule a meeting

​         Meetings can be booked in advance. You can reserve a meeting for a certain period of time, and the reservation list only displays the meetings that are scheduled for the current day. Click on the meeting to enter the meeting. If there are no pending and unfinished conferences, the home page does not display the conference list. The scheduled conference list can display scheduled conferences to be started, completed scheduled conferences, and interrupted conferences due to accidents such as power outages.
