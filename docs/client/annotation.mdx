## 1. How to start annotating

There are two ways to open annotations, one is to directly click the annotation button in the sidebar, and the other is to annotate by lifting the pen below when viewing the document. It allows users to write content in the current screen and make information annotations.

<img  src={useBaseUrl("img/doc-en/批注-en.png")} />

## 2. Annotated scope

The scope of annotation is global annotation, annotation and whiteboard are mutually exclusive, only one can be opened.

<img  src={useBaseUrl("img/doc-en/批注2-en.png")} />
