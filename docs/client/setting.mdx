## 6.1 Internet connection

​        After plugging in a wired network, the icon in the upper right corner will change to a wired network icon. After connecting to a wireless network, the network icon will change to a wireless network icon. If you plug in a network cable and access WiFi at the same time, the network cable will be the default. The opening of the wireless network is synchronized with the wireless hotspot. When the wireless hotspot is turned on, the wireless network will also be turned on synchronously. When the wireless hotspot is turned off, the wireless network will also be turned off synchronously. If you only turn on the wireless network without connecting to any wireless network without connecting to the wired network, the wireless hotspot can be connected but cannot access the Internet. The modification of the wireless hotspot name can be carried out through the device name module set.

## 6.2 Meeting Services

​      The meeting service is mainly a function for uploading files to the service background and offline use. If the network service is activated, the files in the meeting can be uploaded to the meeting background, and the saved files and meeting records can be viewed in the background. If this function is turned off, it means offline use, and it is a stand-alone mode, and the meeting can be entered normally, but the networking function is not available. The stand-alone mode only has [Quick Meeting] and [Confidential Meeting], without [Reserved Meeting]. When meeting in stand-alone mode, files can only be saved in [Local] or [USB Disk], without [Share] or [Save to Meeting]. Functions such as [Sign In], [Vote], [Rating], [File Quick Transfer] are not available in stand-alone mode. Meeting Services needs to be set up outside the meeting.
