## 1. What is whiteboard

​      Whiteboard is a multi-functional writing application that helps users communicate and connect efficiently, brings a relaxed experience, and improves team efficiency. You can click the "Whiteboard" application icon in the meeting, or the "Whiteboard" button on the bottom of the all-in-one machine to detect the bullet box. After the meeting, you can scan the code to take away the content of the whiteboard, and the key points of the meeting will not be missed.
