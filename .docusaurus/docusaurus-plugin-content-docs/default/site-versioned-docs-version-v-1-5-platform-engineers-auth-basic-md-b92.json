  "description": "In KubeVela v1.4, Authentication & Authorization mechanism is introduced. This allows applications to dispatch and manage resources using the identity of the application's creator/modifier. With this feature, it will be easy to limit the access of KubeVela users/applications and isolate their living spaces, which will make your KubeVela system safer.",
