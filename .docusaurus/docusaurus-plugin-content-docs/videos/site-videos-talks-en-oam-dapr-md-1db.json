  "description": "Join Azure CTO, Mark Russinovich, for a view on the future of app development and deployment. Mark explains and shows the future direction of defining and deploying applications with Open Application Model (OAM) and rudr, allowing application developers and operators to write and describe apps that are deploy-able across different infrastructures. He will also introduce and demonstrate the new distributed application runtime (dapr) project, which helps developers write scalable, resilient code through microservice building blocks. Mark will be showcasing these new projects in his talk through a variety of on-stage demos.",
